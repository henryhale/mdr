# Micro Data Recognition (MDR)

![gameplay](./media/screenshot-2.png)

</div>

## Overview

This project showcases a pattern recognition game inspired by the Apple TV+ series [_"Severance"_](<https://wikipedia.org/wiki/Severance_(TV_series)>).
Unlike the show's macro data refinement based on emotional response, this game focuses on logical deductions through mathematical patterns.

As someone who enjoys solving Sudoku puzzles, playing number games and exploring experimental ideas, _MDR_ combines all those elements. The goal is to train your brain to detect hidden patterns in randomly generated datasets.

## Concept

In the world of Lumon Industries, employees on the severed floor work with mysterious data.
This game reimagines that concept by challenging players to identify and manipulate mathematical patterns within a large grid divided into subgrids(3x3, 2x3, 2x4, ...).

Each subgrid contains a specific mathematical pattern such as:
- Linear sequences
- Fibonacci numbers
- Prime numbers
- Square numbers
- ... and more.

## Live Demo

- [**Launch**](https://henryhale.github.io/mdr/) :rocket: - _(for desktop use only)_

## Gameplay

You are presented with a grid of single-digit numbers. Your task is to identify and select numbers that belong to hidden mathematical patterns.

1. Examine the grid
2. Identify the pattern in each subgrid
3. Select a subgrid to "refine" (empty and refill with a new pattern)
4. Continue identifying and refining patterns

The goal is to train your pattern recognition skills much like the severed employess of Lumon Industries train their intuition to refine data.

## Technical Implementation

This game is built with Vanilla TypeScript and Tailwind CSS, with no external dependencies. 

**Components**: Here is how it is made;

- The game grid consists of multiple **layers** stacked together.
- Each layer includes one or more **pattern-based subgrids** with increasing complexity.
- Layers are merged into one visible grid, where **top layers take visual precedence**, like overlapping transparent cards.

**Rules & Scoring**:

- **Correct selection** of a full subgrid on the topmost visible layer awards points.
- Once a valid pattern is cleared, it either reveals lower layers or is replaced with random digits.
- **Incorrect selections have no penalty**, but they create cognitive confusionâ€”challenging your focus.

**Win Condition**:

- All subgrids in every layer must be correctly identified and cleared.
- Final grid should contain only random, patternless numbers.
- Game progress must reach **100%** to win a level.

## Getting Started

**Preresquisites**:

- Node.js (v22+)
- Typescript (v5)
